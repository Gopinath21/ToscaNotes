XML scanning used for api 
====================================================

Open.Create XM 

====================================================

XML : extensible markup language much like HTML ]
Purpose : Store and tranport data
XML does not do anything 

XML tags are not predefined like HTML are.
The XLM language has no predefined tags.

in HTML : have predefined tags.
with XLM , the author must define both tags and document structure.

===================================================

XML simplifies things :=

it simplifies data sharing 
it simplifies data transport 
it simplifies platform changes
it simplifies data availability

XML stores data in plain text format. This provides a software- and hardware-independent way of storing, transporting, and sharing data.

XML also makes it easier to expand or upgrade to new operating systems, new applications, or new browsers, without losing data.


=================================================================
XML Separates Data from Presentation
XML does not carry any information about how to be displayed.

The same XML data can be used in many different presentation scenarios.

Because of this, with XML, there is a full separation between data and presentation
===================================================================
XML Tree:

XML documents form a tree structure that starts at "the root" and branches to "the leaves".

XML Syntax Rules:

The syntax rules of XML are very simple and logical. The rules are easy to learn, and easy to use.


XML documents must contain one root element that is the parent of all other elements:

In XML, it is illegal to omit the closing tag. All elements must have a closing tag:

XML Tags are Case Sensitive

Opening and closing tags must be written with the same case:


If you place a character like "<" inside an XML element, it will generate an error because the parser interprets it as the start of a new element.

avoid this error, replace the "<" character with an entity reference:

XML does not truncate multiple white-spaces (HTML truncates multiple white-spaces to one single white-space):

XML Stores New Line as LF.

====================================================================
XML Attributes:

XML Attributes Must be Quoted
Attribute values must always be quoted. Either single or double quotes can be used.

For a person's gender, the <person> element can be written like this:
If the attribute value itself contains double quotes you can use single quotes,



Avoid XML Attributes:
Some things to consider when using attributes are:

attributes cannot contain multiple values (elements can)
attributes cannot contain tree structures (elements can)
attributes are not easily expandable (for future changes)
==========================================================================================

Solving the Name Conflict Using a Prefix
Name conflicts in XML can easily be avoided using a name prefix.

This XML carries information about an HTML table, and a piece of furniture:

<h:table>
  <h:tr>
    <h:td>Apples</h:td>
    <h:td>Bananas</h:td>
  </h:tr>
</h:table>

<f:table>
  <f:name>African Coffee Table</f:name>
  <f:width>80</f:width>
  <f:length>120</f:length>
</f:table>
